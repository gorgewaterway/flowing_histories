        "Description": "The establishment of the colony of Vancouver Island in 1849 was followed by land purchases from First Nations and the signing of the Douglas Treaty throughout the 1850's. An important distinction to make is that Indigenous Peoples in southern Vancouver Island and around Port Hardy negoited the terms of such treaties orally and the written document was created after the fact. James Douglas provided a few materials good such as cash, clothing and blankets and agrees that signatories and their descendants would retain their village sites and fields as well as the “liberty to hunt over unoccupied lands” and the right to “carry on their fisheries as formerly.”. These terms were in no way upheld by the Hudsons Bay Company and later the government of Canada.",

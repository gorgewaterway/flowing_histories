One involved constructing a permanent dam at the Gorge's narrowest point and creating a canal from Portage Inlet to Thetis Cove. Alternatively, he suggested filling the waterway between the Craigflower Bridge and the Gorge Bridge to expand land for new buildings and homes. Day believed that protecting the inlet from harbour contamination would allow water from the Colquitz and Deadman’s Rivers to purify it. He argued that pollution stemmed not only from septic tanks around the Gorge but also significantly from industrial and commercial activities in and around Victoria's harbour. This proposal was envisioned as part of a postwar rehabilitation plan, which also included establishing a park at Portage Inlet featuring picnic grounds, a public beach, and a boat landing—necessitated by wartime gasoline and rubber rationing efforts.",

This cable plays a crucial role in supplying electricity to Greater Victoria. The objective is to upgrade to the latest transmission cable technology, ensuring long-term reliability and safety of the electricity supply. The replacement involves transitioning from a direct-buried, oil-filled cable to an oil-free cable installed within a duct bank. Once the new cable is operational, the existing underground cable will be decommissioned, removed, and recycled. ",

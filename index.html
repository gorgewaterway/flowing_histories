        <h3>Stewarded Lands
        </h3>
        <p>
          James Douglas anchors off of Clover Point for the first time in 1842, stunned by the result of lək̓ʷəŋən Peoples stewardship of the land. Practices included controlled burns and food cultivation, especially of the starchy bulb of Camas, which when flowering, created seas of purple that Douglas compared to the Gardens of Eden. Douglas was not the first colonial captain to be impressed by the Camas meadows. Captain Vancouver had taken shelter on Tlchess, the lək̓ʷəŋən name for Discovery Island, in 1792 and described the landscape as enchantingly beautiful without any knowledge of the hard work by the female ancestors of the Indigenous family groups.

            Following Douglas’ initial trip to Vancouver Island, in 1849, the Colonial Office of Britain permitted the Hudson Bay Company to settle and promote colonization of the island for 7 shillings a year for 10 years. One year later, the Douglas Treaties began to be negotiated between 14 Indigenous groups and James Douglas, representing the HBC. An important distinction to make is that Indigenous Peoples in southern Vancouver Island and around Port Hardy negotiated the terms of such treaties orally and the written document was created after the fact. Some signatories signed blank pieces of paper to which the terms of the agreement were written up later by the HBC. James Douglas provided a few materials such as cash, clothing and blankets and agreed that signatories and their descendants would retain their village sites and fields as well as the “liberty to hunt over unoccupied lands” and the right to “carry on their fisheries as formerly”. These terms were in no way upheld by the Hudson's Bay Company and later the government of Canada.

        <p>
            In the 20 years following the signing of the Douglas Treaties, Vancouver Island became increasingly settled especially during the peak of the Gold Rush. Initialized by American visitors celebrating July 4th, the American Day of Independence, large boat races called regattas were held and eventually moved to May 24th, Queen Victoria's Birthday. Races originally included Navy personnel, local clubs, Chinese boat races and Indigenous canoe races. These events became more segregated as time went on.

In 1876, it was in this hybrid canoe that a Songhees team won a 3.2km race in approximately 15 minutes.

          Originally built in 1919 as a railway bridge to facilitate the unloading of logs from Vancouver Island's logging industry, the Selkirk Trestle enabled logs to be pushed off trains directly into the Gorge. Tugboats then transported the logs to the nearby pulp mill. Today, it serves as a segment of the Galloping Goose Trail, popular for cycling commuters and recreational runners and walkers of all speeds. Constructed from fir and hemlock, this 300-meter-long trestle includes a movable middle section that can be raised to allow tall ships to pass underneath.

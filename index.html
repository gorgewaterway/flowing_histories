            This is the land of the lək̓ʷəŋən, specifically the Songhees and Esquimalt, and the W̱SÁNEĆ, made up of the Tsartlip, Tseycum, Pauquachin and Tsawout, Peoples. These Nations are the living descendants of the families that have hunted and gathered on, and stewarded the land since time immemorial. The phrase 'time immemorial' is used when there is no longer a memory of the a point in time, as it occured so long ago. To learn more about the Creation stories of the W̱SÁNEĆ and the lək̓ʷəŋən People, we encourage you to learn from the respected storytellers of these Nations and participate in education opportunities held by the Nations.

        <h3>Stewarded Lands
        </h3>
        <p>
          James Douglas anchored off of Clover Point for the first time in 1842, stunned by the result of lək̓ʷəŋən Peoples stewardship of the land. Practices included controlled burns and food cultivation, especially of the starchy bulb of Camas, which when flowering, created seas of purple that Douglas compared to the Gardens of Eden. Douglas was not the first colonial captain to be impressed by the Camas meadows. Captain Vancouver had taken shelter on Tlchess, the lək̓ʷəŋən name for Discovery Island, in 1792 and described the landscape as enchantingly beautiful without any knowledge of the hard work by the female ancestors of the Indigenous family groups.

        <h3>The Colony of Vancouver Island</h3>
        <p>
            Following Douglas’ initial trip to Vancouver Island, in 1849, the Colonial Office of Britain permitted the Hudson Bay Company to settle and promote colonization of the island for 7 shillings a year for 10 years. One year later, the Douglas Treaties began to be negotiated between 14 Indigenous groups and James Douglas, representing the HBC. An important distinction to make is that Indigenous Peoples in southern Vancouver Island and around Port Hardy negotiated the terms of such treaties orally and the written document was created after the fact. Some signatories signed blank pieces of paper to which the terms of the agreement were written up later by the HBC. James Douglas provided a few materials such as cash, clothing and blankets and agreed that signatories and their descendants would retain their village sites and fields as well as the “liberty to hunt over unoccupied lands” and the right to “carry on their fisheries as formerly”. These terms were in no way upheld by the Hudson's Bay Company and later the government of Canada.

            In the 20 years following the signing of the Douglas Treaties, Vancouver Island became increasingly settled especially during the peak of the Gold Rush. Initialized by American visitors celebrating July 4th, the American Day of Independence, large boat races called regattas were held and eventually moved to May 24th, Queen Victoria's Birthday. Races originally included Navy personnel, local clubs, Chinese boat races and Indigenous canoe races. These events became more segregated as time went on.

        <h3>Reefballs Introduced to the Gorge</h3>
        <p>
In 2017, three 350-pound hollow concrete artificial reefs (reefballs) were introduced into the Gorge, featuring large holes designed to facilitate water flow and promote oyster settlement, offering them a habitat above muddy substrates.

GWAS expanded its impact with the creation of the Restoration Program in 2017, followed by the Biology Program in 2018, Indigenous Youth Program in 2022 and Climate Interpreter Program in 2023. The Nature House is the hub at which staff and community members take part in restoration events, biological monitoring and environmental education events.

In mid-July 2022, Aryze Developments launched a floating public swim dock featuring a Japanese katsura tree, positioned near the Banfield public dock. In 2022, the City committed $300,000 to construct another swimming platform and install buoys to designate a protected swim zone. In 2024, further enhancements were established, such as a life-jacket loaner station, anchored buoys for a recreational swimming area, and additional swim steps to improve accessibility and safety.

        <p>
Eelgrass is a keystone species which grows in shallow saltwater areas. Microorganisms such as algae and bacteria grow on the surface of the eelgrass leaves, which provides food for many marine organisms. Monitoring of the health of eelgrass in the Gorge was initiated in 2022 and continues annually.

        <h3>Green Crab Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
Since 2022, GWAS has participated in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ European Green Crab Monitoring Project. European green crabs are a destructive invasive species that removes eelgrass very efficiently, destroying habitat for everything else in the Gorge. Unfortunately, teams caught adult European green crabs in the Gorge for the first time in August 2024 through the monitoring program. GWAS is working with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Peninsula Streams Society to remove as many as possible before the problem worsens. To prevent the spread of European Green Crabs, make sure to clean, drain, and dry off any watercraft according to BC Invasives.

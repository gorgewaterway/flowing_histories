        <h3>Stewarded Lands
        </h3>
        <p>
          James Douglas anchored off of Clover Point for the first time in 1842, stunned by the result of lək̓ʷəŋən Peoples stewardship of the land. Practices included controlled burns and food cultivation, especially of the starchy bulb of Camas, which when flowering, created seas of purple that Douglas compared to the Gardens of Eden. Douglas was not the first colonial captain to be impressed by the <a href="https://youtu.be/0qXfl_g7iIM?si=_JVd0eYeBmmuv7-T" target="_blank">Camas</a> meadows. Captain Vancouver had taken shelter on Tlchess, the lək̓ʷəŋən name for Discovery Island, in 1792 and described the landscape as enchantingly beautiful without any knowledge of the hard work by the female ancestors of the Indigenous family groups.

        <h3>The Colony of Vancouver Island</h3>
        <p>
            Following Douglas’ initial trip to Vancouver Island, in 1849, the <a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/learn/discover-your-legislature/1849-vancouver-island-becomes-a-colony" target="_blank">Colonial Office of Britain</a> permitted the Hudson Bay Company to settle and promote colonization of the island for 7 shillings a year for 10 years. One year later, the Douglas Treaties began to be negotiated between 14 Indigenous groups and James Douglas, representing the HBC. An important distinction to make is that Indigenous Peoples in southern Vancouver Island and around Port Hardy negotiated the terms of such treaties orally and the written document was created after the fact. Some signatories signed blank pieces of paper to which the terms of the agreement were written up later by the HBC. James Douglas provided a few materials such as cash, clothing and blankets and agreed that signatories and their descendants would retain their village sites and fields as well as the “liberty to hunt over unoccupied lands” and the right to “carry on their fisheries as formerly”. These terms were in no way upheld by the Hudson's Bay Company and later the government of Canada.

        <h3>Regattas as Identity</h3>
        <p>
            In the 20 years following the signing of the Douglas Treaties, Vancouver Island became increasingly settled especially during the peak of the Gold Rush. Initialized by American visitors celebrating July 4th, the American Day of Independence, large boat races called <a href="https://grantkeddie.com/2024/09/indigenous-canoe-racing-on-the-gorge-waterway/" target="_blank">regattas</a> were held and eventually moved to May 24th, Queen Victoria's Birthday. Races originally included Navy personnel, local clubs, Chinese boat races and Indigenous canoe races. These events became more segregated as time went on.

         The pollution in the Gorge was linked to typhoid outbreaks in 1939, further degrading the reputation of the once pristine waterway. Before swimming in the Gorge, check the beach advisories provided by <a href="https://inspections.myhealthdepartment.com/island-health/beach-advisory" target="_blank">Island Health</a> to ensure the water is safe to swim in.

After urban development, poor waste management and lack of awareness, the Gorge again became incredibly polluted throughout the 70's and 80's. In 1994, John and Wesley Roe, a <a href="https://www.salishsea.ca/" target="_blank">father-son</a> duo started removing debris from the Gorge in an effort to address the pollution. "We pulled out every household item you can think of: microwaves, couches, beds, lots of broken glass, shopping carts" said Roe when cleanups started gaining momentum. John is still an active part of Gorge cleanups to this day.

        <h3>Settling Ponds Created</h3>
        <p>
The creation of the settling ponds was a key feature of the 2005 daylighting of Gorge Creek. Approximately 1/3 of the run-off from the Township of Esquimalt comes through this culvert, bringing with it many pollutants from roads and ditches. Most of the flow is diverted into the upper pond where it slows for sediment to settle out. Cattails, sedges, and rushes in and around the pond help to filter contaminants. The lower pond creates habitat for waterfoul, forage fish and insects.

        <h3>Banfield Public Swimming Dock</h3>
        <p>
In mid-July 2022, Aryze Developments launched a <a href="https://www.victoria.ca/city-government/news/expanded-banfield-park-dock-opens#:~:text=In%20May%202023%2C%20Council%20directed,water%20access%20to%20the%20Gorge." target="_blank">floating public swim dock</a> featuring a Japanese katsura tree, positioned near the Banfield public dock. In 2022, the City committed $300,000 to construct another swimming platform and install buoys to designate a protected swim zone. In 2024, further enhancements were established, such as a life-jacket loaner station, anchored buoys for a recreational swimming area, and additional swim steps to improve accessibility and safety.

        <h3>Eelgrass Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
<a href="https://www.gorge.ca/projects/eelgrass-survey" target="_blank">Eelgrass</a> is a keystone species which grows in shallow saltwater areas. Microorganisms such as algae and bacteria grow on the surface of the eelgrass leaves, which provides food for many marine organisms. Monitoring of the health of eelgrass in the Gorge was initiated in 2022 and continues annually.

        <h3>Green Crab Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
Since 2022, GWAS has participated in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ European Green Crab Monitoring Project. European green crabs are a destructive invasive species that removes eelgrass very efficiently, destroying habitat for everything else in the Gorge. Unfortunately, teams caught adult European green crabs in the Gorge for the first time in August 2024 through the monitoring program. GWAS is working with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Peninsula Streams Society to remove as many as possible before the problem worsens. To prevent the spread of <a href="https://www.gorge.ca/projects/european-green-crab-monitoring" target="_blank">European Green Crabs</a>, make sure to clean, drain, and dry off any watercraft according to BC Invasives.

        <h3>Salt Marsh Restoration</h3>
        <p>
At the mouth of Gorge Creek and flowing into the Gorge Waterway, the restored <a href="https://www.gorge.ca/projects/gorge-creek-salt-marsh" target="_blank">salt marsh</a> is home to critically rare habitat and unique vegetated species. Since 2022, GWAS has removed invasive species, planted native species, stabilized banks and conducted annual biophysical surveys to continue care in this ecosystem.

        <p>
          Thank you for exploring the flowing history of the Gorge Waterway with us. Keep in mind that this map is incomplete at this time, leaving room for an ongoing conversation. Much like the process of creating this map, we hope that interaction with this map is iterative, inviting you to come back to it and dive deeper each time. Think about what you will do with this information, if that means participating in <a href="https://www.gorge.ca/events" target="_blank">weekly restoration </a>, signing up for a <a href="https://www.tourismvictoria.com/things-to-do/arts-culture-history/indigenous/songhees-tours" target="_blank">Songhees Tour</a> or getting involved in Land Back iniatives.
